OO Basic
    1. Abstraction
    2. Encapsulation
    3. Polymorphism
    4. Inheritance

OO Principle
    1. DP: Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
    2. DP: Program to an interface, not an implementation.
    3. DP: Favor composition over inheritance.

OO Patterns
    The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
    Strategy  lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
